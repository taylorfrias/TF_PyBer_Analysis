When reviewing the Summary Data Frame you can see a negative correlation between the average fare and the total rides. Rural areas have the lowest total ride total with the highest average fare per ride. Compared to Urban cities with a larger amount of rides with a lower average fare. This could be due to the fact that Urban Cities are more condensed, meaning driver are driving shorter distances which correlate to lower fares. While in Rural cities, drivers drive further to get to their destination which mean longer trip, higher fares. The reason the overall total fares are higher in Urban cities is due to the abundancy of riders compared to Rural areas. 

While reviewing the, Average Fare by City Type, line graph we can interpret that Urban cities earn the most in fares compared to rural cities. Although they fluctuate weekly, the highest average is always held by Urban cities. Meaning that if your going to be working in Pyber, it is better to work in an Urban city compared to Rural cities.
